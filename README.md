This program uses CV2 to detect if any faces are in frame.
CV2 opens and uses your camera to scan for any faces. 
When no face is detected the camera window will display text stating "NO FACE"
When a face is detected, a 200x200 mini window will appear with a zoomed in display of the face while displaying "FACE DETECTED".
The mini window will disappear once the face is out of frame.
Press "q" to end the python program.
